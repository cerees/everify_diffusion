Recent state level immigration legislation by numerous states including Arizona, Georgia, and Alabama have sparked conversations about the role of state level control of immigration.  Though these perceived encroachments into an area typically seen as a federal level of governance may seem recent, and are often portrayed as such in the popular press, the reality of state involvement in immigration is that it has been present in its enforcement since the founding of the country (Neuman 1993; Neuman 1996).  Historically states targeted institutions such as healthcare and employers to control immigration.  More recent immigration reform, beginning with California Proposition 187, has mirrored these historical developments by regulating immigration in a more nuanced form of governmental social control (Varsanyi 2010).  These more nuanced forms of state social control have avoided the use of the criminal justice system as the primary arm of enforcement and have instead focused on utilizing the legislatures purse strings and other regulatory mechanisms to monitor institutions such as healthcare, education, and employment.
Despite the recent and historical participation of states in the regulation of immigration, to my knowledge no empirical research has examined the issue at the state level.  This gap in the extant sociological literature and more specifically the sociological literature is particularly surprising given the prominence of immigration, health, education and the labor market as core areas of sociological enquiry.  More specifically, the extant literature has failed to examine the determinants of why and when states decide to adopt legislation that aims at controlling immigration.  The present analysis will focus more narrowly on what predicts the timing of state adoption of one such state regulation, that of the E-Verify System.

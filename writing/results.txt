Table 2 presents the coefficients for the discrete-time event history analysis.  The effect of time is predictably positive and in the expected direction indicating that as time passes the probability of adopting E-Verify regulations increases.  Concerning the focal independent variables that measure the concepts of racial and economic threat and partisan politics many are only marginally significant.  The measures of racial threat receive minimal support.  The variable for percent black approaches significance at the .100 level and is in the expected positive direction indicating that as a states black population increases their likelihood of adopting E-verify legislation sooner in time increases.  The other variables measuring racial threat, percent Hispanic and percent foreign-born do not however, reach significance.  Unemployment, the measure of economic threat, is also non-significant.
The measures of partisan politics also receive moderate support, but only approach statistical significance.  Though only approaching significance at the .10 level, the positive coefficient for the measure of republican presidential years indicates that states adopted E-Verify policies more rapidly during these years.  The measure of republican legislature also approached statistical significance and was in the expected positive direction.  This indicates that states with republican legislatures adopted E-Verify policies more promptly than states controlled by their democratic counterparts.
